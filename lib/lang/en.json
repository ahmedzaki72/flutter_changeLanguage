  "about" : "Monsoons blow in some parts of Asia. A monsoon is a wind. It blows from the Indian Ocean. It brings heavy rains.\n\nHeavy rain is a problem for old buildings. Water breaks up the foundations of buildings. Buildings then fall down. Many buildings fall down in India. This year, monsoons have an impact on 2.4 million Indian people.\n\nLast week, a building falls down in central India. Eight people die. At least eleven people are hurt. Some people are trapped in the ruins. Rescuers try to save them"
